# Quadratic Solver

This is a python challenge that calculates the real roots of quadratic equations from an excel spreadsheet.

## Overview

The 'test.xlsx' file contains a table of three columns labelled **a**, **b**, **c** accordingly. This represents the general quadratic equation **ax^2+bx+c = 0**. A row represents an equation and can be filled as many times as wanted. The 'main.py' file reads, calculates and write the roots in a tabular form, x1 and x2, in a new worksheet labelled **Output**.
**NB**: The directory of the excel file must be properly referenced to aviod errors.

## Requirements

These libraries are required for the for excel file to be read and written:

- Panda library
- Openpyxl

Click [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) to install Panda library and [here](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) to install openpyxl library

## How it Works

- Enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation into the columns of the table of the 'test.xlsx' file.
- Run the python program 'main.py'
- Check the worksheet labelled 'Output' in the Excel file.
